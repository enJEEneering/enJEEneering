              <p>IIT Bombay, which conducts UCEED every year, announced this year that a 60 marks drawing question will be asked in the paper, to check the ability to draw products, people or scenes in proportion with good line quality, composition, proportion, perspective, and shading. Let’s look at some topics to focus on during UCEED preparation.</p>
			  <h3>1. Sketching and Perception drawing</h3>
			  <p>The Most important and key requirement of a drawing is its sketching and perception drawing. If the basic structure of a drawing is good you will be able to fetch more marks. Following are some resources to practice sketching and perspective drawing:</p>
			  <p>1. Sketching different views and drawing techniques – <a href="https://amzn.to/2ucNqGz">Pencil Drawing Techniques by David Lewis</a> 
              <br>2. Sketching techniques and different facets of design (including perspective, shadowing, shading, texture, architectural facts etc) - <a href="https://amzn.to/2QGivK3">Design drawing by Francis D.K.Ching </a>
              <br>3. A book which covers most of the rendering topics (including perspective projections) - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FaKsV1">Basic Rendering by Robert W.Gill</a> (only for those who have sufficient time)  
              <br>4. A good book on Perspective drawing and a complete beginner’s guide, <a href="https://amzn.to/2sDySzf">Perspective Drawing handbook by Joseph D'Amelio</a> 
			  <br><h6>Apart from Books there are some Youtube videos to help with size, proportion and human sketching</h6></p>

			  <p>Japanese usually call comic strips as manga. A Comic Strip is a very good/creative form of communicating a story or idea in pictorial forms, usually with comments (also called callout). Let's check the related pages for comic strip improvement
