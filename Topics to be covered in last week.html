              <p>Hello Guys, Today I will tell you the topics, studying which you can definitely improve your score by 36-40 marks. These are the topics which do not require much preparation just simple reading from NCERT Textbook will help you out. So now lets see these topics:
              
              <br> <br> <h5>1. CHEMISTRY</h5>  
			  <br><h6>a. Environmental chemistry</h6> This is 14 th Chapter in <a href="https://amzn.to/36iHwkM">11th Standard NCERT</a>, which covers the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. This topic might seem very boring to many of you but it is easy to cover and hardly takes a single reading of about 2-3 hours from NCERT Textbook. So completing this topic you can definitely add "4 MARKS" to your basket.
              <br><br><h6>b. Biomolecules</h6>This is 14th chapter of <a href="https://amzn.to/38nbRk0">class 12 NCERT book</a>, which explains what biomolecules are and how they interact with each other and constitute the molecular logic of life processes. The structures and functions of some of these biomolecules are also discussed in the chapter. Sounds heavy right. But let me tell you that questions from this chapter mostly repeats in Mains and is mostly asked every year. So, you can add "4 more Marks" if you do previous years questions of this topic
			  <br><br><h6>c. Polymers</h6> This chapter deals with the study of polymers, classify polymers based on their molecular forces, list the types of polymerization, explain the terms Monomer, Polymer, Polymerisation, classify polymers based on the source and based on the structure. This is a very easy chapter and in few readings from NCERT & Previous years' papers, you will be able to solve its question easily in JEE Main 2020. So, you can add "4 Marks".
              <br><br><h6>d. Chemistry in everyday life</h6> The last chapter of the book discusses an important concept â€“ Drugs and their classifications, Drug Target Interaction, Action of different classes of drugs, the chemicals in food, Cleansing Agents like Soaps, Synthetic Detergents, etc. This a very interesting yet difficult chapter because it requires remembering a lot, but in this chapter also you can add "4 Marks", if <a href="https://amzn.to/36jb41W">Previous years' questions</a> and NCERT back exercises are done properly. 
			  
              <br> <br> <h5>PHYSICS</h5>  
              <br><h6>a. Communication system</h6>Last Chapter of <a href="https://amzn.to/36j4Lvg">Class 12 NCERT Textbook</a>. You will get introduced to the communication systems, the transmitter, the channel and the receiver. The chapter also fills your pool of knowledge with information about transmission medium bandwidth, amplitude modulation, and its necessity, how amplitude modulated waves are formed and can be detected, electromagnetic waves and their propagation, etc. This sounds Heavy, right. But Solve NCERT back exercise and previous years' papers to get through the question. 
              <br> <br><h6>b. Semiconductor </h6> This is a topic which most of the students fear and do not understand. However, even if you do not understand Transisters, etc don't worry there are a few repeated questions which are asked in Mains every year. So solve <a href="https://amzn.to/2rkJen8">Previous years' questions</a> to Crack this topic and get "4 Marks".
              <br> <br><h6>c. Formulas from EM waves, Viscosity and Elasticity and Fluid Mechanics</h6> These are very easy Topics, but we often forget to revise their formulas from <a href="https://amzn.to/2P4VsJn">NCERT Textbook</a> and end up loosing easy 4 marks on these topics.

              <br> <br> <h5>MATHEMATICS</h5>
			  <br><h6>a. Mathematical reasoning</h6> This is a very easy chapter, which involves use of truth tables, etc. Even then it is found out that majority of the students aren't able to solve this question because they haven't even studied this Chapter. Solving Back exercise of <a href="https://amzn.to/2PrGwUT">NCERT</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2P2t5LS">Previous year questions</a> will help you earn 4 easy marks.
			  <br> <br><h6>b. Hights and Distances</h6> This is also a very easy Chapter which most of you have done in class 10 also. Thus, merely revising this chapter can earn you "4 Marks".
			  <br> <br><h6>c. Statistics</h6> This Chapter just invovles simple application of 2-3 repeated formulas and is asked every year without any doubt, so do not loose this opportunity and revise these formulas and get "4 Marks"
