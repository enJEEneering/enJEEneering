                     <p class="excert">
                        I guess most of you might have played some or the other games in your life either on PC or Mobile. Some of you might have also wondered how these games are made and would have dreamt of making a game, one day.
This is due to the games like PUBG and Asphalt, which are becoming more and more popular day by day and people now not only want to participate in playing but also creating them!!!</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/PUBG_MOBILE.jpg" width="48%" alt="">
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/asphalt9.jpg" width="48%" alt="">
<p><br>So if you want to know ‘How to Get Started’ with Game Development, this article is perfect for you as it will teach you the basics and provide you with various resources that will take you further on your journey. </p>
<p>Let’s start with knowing what Game development (or as we say game dev) is.</p>
 
<h3>What is Game Development?</h3>
<p>Game Development or game dev is the art of creating games which includes the design, development and release of a game. </p>
<p>It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.</p>
 
<h3>Who is a Game Developer?</h3>
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/blog/gamedeveloper.png" width="100%"alt="">
<p><br>A game developer could be a programmer, a sound designer, an artist, a designer or many other roles available in the industry.</p>
<p>Game Development can be undertaken by a large Game Development Studio or by a single individual. It can be as small or large as you like. As long as it lets the player interact with content and is able to manipulate the game’s elements, you can call it a ‘game’.</p>
<p>To get involved in the Game Development process, you do not need to write code. Artists may create and design assets, a sound designer might add required voice and sound, while a Developer might focus on programming a health bar, a game tester may get involved to see that the game works as expected.</p>
<h3>What are the Different Components in Game Development?</h3>
<p>There are many different components in Game Development that can either be handled by a single developer who is individually creating a game (and who is a genius!!!) or normally by a team of multiple people. So if you want to get started with Game Development, it’s best to first understand the various components in this field so that you can identify the ones that most interest you.</p>
<h4>1. Story:</h4> <p>Everything has a story and that is equally true for video games!!! Your story can have a linear structure which is relatively easy, or it can even have a non-linear structure with various plot changes according to character actions. The main point is that there should be an interesting story to hook your players!!!</p>
<h4>2. Characters:</h4> <p> Do you know any story without characters? No! That’s because, after the story, the characters are a fundamental part of any video game. You have to decide the looks and personalities of the characters, how fast they should move, what should be the manners and characteristics etc.</p>
<h4>3. Audio:</h4> <p>It is the backbone of video games!!! That means it should support the game and yet not be too obvious! You have to decide the various sounds in the game world like player sounds, background music, etc. that together create a lifelike and believable video game.</p>
<h4>4. Art:</h4> <p>It can be said that video games are basically just responsive art!!! So art is very important as it decides the feel of the game. Normally art in video games can include various things like the game texture, game lighting, 3D modeling of characters and objects, particle systems to create fire, fog, snow, etc.</p>
<h4>5. Lighting:</h4> <p>All the lighting in video games is obviously artificial and very important for mood setting. Less lighting can be used in association with horror or thriller games while increased lighting can denote more adventure or fun games. Also, lighting can be an important factor in stealth challenges with darker areas providing cover to characters.</p>
<h4>6. Levels:</h4> <p>All good video games have various levels that increase the difficulty as time goes on. Levels can be denoted in games by multiple floors, different buildings, or even different countries (Depending on the game you are playing!) and each level can have many potential paths that eventually lead to the next level. And designing games with many possible path combinations for different levels is a big factor in Game Development.</p>
<h3>How to Start Learning Game Development?</h3>
<p>Now that you have understood all the components involved in Game Development, the topics provided here are a roadmap that is enough to make you understand the basics of Learning Game Development. After learning these you can make a decent game and then move on to creating more and more complex worlds as you progress.</p>
<h4>1. Learn Computer Programming:</h4> <p>The interesting world-view in a game is all created using Computer programming. So it stands to reason that you need to know programming in case you want to enter this world! Now if you have some basic knowledge about coding in programming languages like C++, <a href="course-details_C%23.html">C#</a>, Python, Java, etc. then great, otherwise it’s best if you learn programming before moving any further.</p>
<b>Note:</b> <p>If you are a total beginner, you can refer to <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University</a> to get a basic understanding of Computer programming.</p>
<h4>2. Choose a known Game Engine:</h4> 
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/unity.jpg" width="100%"alt="">
<p>Many developers choose to develop a game using a Game Development Engine.</p>
<p>Game Engines can make the process of creating a game much easier and enable developers to reuse lots of functionality. It also takes care of rendering for 2D and 3D Graphics, physics and collision detection, sound, scripting and much more.</p>
<p>Some Game Engines have a very steep learning curve such as CryEngine or Unreal Engine. Yet, other tools are very accessible to beginners and some do not even need you to be able to write code to create your game, e.g. Construct 2.</p>
<p>The Unity Game Engine ranges somewhere in the middle, while it is beginner friendly, some popular and commercial games have been built using Unity (e.g. Overcooked, Superhot).</p>
<p>The BuildBox game engine is basically for developing hyper casual games.</p>
<p>The most popular Game Engine is <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> as it is quite easy to learn, and also has the personal edition which is free! Another popular Game Engine is the Unreal Engine which can be modified to create unique games. However, eventually it doesn’t matter what Game Engine you use but what matters is that you stick with that game engine so that you understand it well enough to use it in future projects.</p>
<h4>3. Create a Basic Game:</h4> <p>Now that you have some idea of Game Development, create a basic game. Now you might want to get carried away and wish to create a masterpiece but trust me and start small!! Try to keep your project around a week or so because the most important thing now is not that you become a master overnight but that you understand the basics.</p>
<p>A common first game is <a href="https://tetris.com/">Tetris</a> as it is easy to make and yet it will introduce you to many concepts in Game Development. It will basically teach you about the three steps in the Game Loop i.e. initialize, update and draw which are at the heart of any possible game development you will do in the future.</p>
<h4>4. Understand Game Design Patterns: </h4>
<p>Suppose that you have to put in multiple asteroids that destroy a spaceship in a space video game. It is much wiser in this situation to have a code module that can be reused again and again for the asteroids rather than focusing on individual asteroids. This is a Game Design Pattern known as <b>Object pooling</b>. </p>
<p>Similarly, there are many Game Design Patterns that are basically just templates for creating modular code that can be used as a repeated solution for any problem in Game Development.</p>
<p>Some of the other common Game Design Patterns are Flyweight, Prototype, Observer, etc. It’s best that you first understand these Game Patterns and then apply them in various small games. This will help you in understanding the various impacts and benefits that Game Design Patterns can have on Game Development in general.</p>
<b>Note:</b> <p>A fantastic book for learning Game Design Patterns is <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00P5URD96/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=enjee-21&creative=24630&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00P5URD96&linkId=8ac4fdd569560cfef0cd06b09fe71700">Game Programming Patterns</a> by <b>Robert Nystrom</b> that will elaborate on various Design Patterns to optimize your game.</p>
<h4>5. Learn 3D Graphics and Associated Maths:</h4> <p>It is not possible to make a video game without graphics and so you need to learn about them now. And while 2D graphics were quite popular in the mid-1990s, most of the famous games today require 3D graphics which can be rendered in Fixed 3D, First-person perspective, Third-person perspective, etc. which provides a realistic feeling to the game. So if you want to become a top-notch Game Programmer, you should know computer graphics and also the mathematics behind it. This is even more important if you are not planning on using an already-made game engine.</p>
<p>The maths commonly required for 3D Graphics is Linear Algebra which mainly deals with linear equations, matrices, vectors, etc. If you understand these concepts, you can easily manipulate the 3D world of your game to achieve miraculous effects!!!</p>
<b>Note:</b><p> You can learn 3D Graphics in Game Development using <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1568817231/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=enjee-21&creative=24630&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1568817231&linkId=2ffa7275e125afd439646384c0d60413">3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development Book</a> and the Basic Linear Algebra from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c">MIT OpenCourseWare Linear Algebra course</a> available on YouTube.</p>
