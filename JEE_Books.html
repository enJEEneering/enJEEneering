              <p>We are often bombarded with questions primarily with below two topics:
              1- Which JEE coaching center one should join – Kota, Rao, Resonance and so on?
              2- Which book i should study?

              These two questions are indeed important but underlying aim is to discover some secret sauce or a magic potion to clear JEE! Its ok, IIT has such an aura that one naturally tends to discover the secrets to clear it. I am attempting to answer above questions below, hope it helps:

              Which coaching center  is good?

              Answer is simple, all well reputed JEE coaching institutes either in Kota or in other locations are equally good. There is not much difference as such, why? Because their teachers usually changes the job and rotate though them. There’s a poaching for a good teacher across these institutes. Second, the JEE preparation contents (Tutorials, mock tests etc.) too are prepared by these teachers so they don’t differ very differently for any coaching center. So best approach would be to select the coaching center which is convenient for you to join in terms of proximity to your school, home etc. Don’t get too fussy about it, just go ahead and join which seems convenient and also has good reputation in your locality. Coaching center can provide you a good study material, excellent faculty to help you understand the concepts and an environment where like minded people gather. But ultimately its you and your preparation what counts!

Which books to study?

Again students think that if they know some magic books then they can clear the JEE. Its wrong, books are common to all what matters is your focus and ability to grasp the described concepts. In fact it doesn’t make sense to go through many books because your time is finite while books could be infinite. Below is my preferences:

<h6>MATHS</h6>

Solve your coaching material if you are studying in one that'll help you a lot to understand JEE level questions. And according to me that is enough. Even Kalpit Veerwal said in his YouTube channel that he solved just his coaching material and he recommended the same.
However if you want more practice try solving <a href="https://amzn.to/2tqzJmT">Cengage </a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2MSxcJg">Previous year questions</a>.
<h6>PHYSICS</h6>

For Physics <a href="https://amzn.to/2QLLDzA">Concepts of Physics</a> by HC Verma is a must for JEE. Its priority is even more than your coaching material.
After this go for your coaching material and that will be more than enough for Mains.
And for a complete grip over Advanced level problem you can solve <a href="https://amzn.to/2Qmh2tO">DC Pandey otherwise both the above options will be sufficient for Mains as well as Advanced.
And of course go through NCERT.
If you want to have higher level practice try solving <a href="https://amzn.to/2sBlU5c">I.E. Irodov</a>. After this you will be able to solve most of the JEE Advanced questions.

<h6>CHEMISTRY</h6>

NCERT is must for chemistry.
Coaching material.
And that'll be enough for mains and somewhat for Advanced but I'll recommend for higher level problems:

<a href="https://amzn.to/35m4xTh">MS Chauhan</a> for organic ( must for advanced).
<a href="https://amzn.to/39xK15r">RC Mukherjee</a> for physical.
<a href="https://amzn.to/35pBii5">JD Lee</a> for Inorganic (optional).
Note: Previous year's questions are must for all the subject.

If you're able to go through all these then be ready for a good rank and hence a good college with the desired branch.

Just be positive and best of luck.		 <!-- LikeBtn.com BEGIN -->
