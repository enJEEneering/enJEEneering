        <p>For most of the things it is believed that it is better to start as early as possible. This saying is more or less valid for JEE preparation as well. Generally students start preparing for JEE from class 11 itself. And this is the actual time when most of the students, parents and coaching centers also actually start focussing directly on JEE. However, there are many cases when students start preparing right from class 8 or earlier. So might wonder what is the best time to start preparing for JEE?</p>
		<p>Let’s  analyse what is the perfect time to start preparing for JEE or when should you join a JEE coaching. Let’s first see few facts pertaining to class at which students start preparing.</p>
		<h4>Case:1 Students Join coachings in 8 class or earlier.</h4><p>At this stage students are not even aware of JEE is or even does he even really likes Science or not. At this stage students should be given open space to explore themselves, their interests and liking for different subjects. Forcing them into some JEE coaching might end up not liking the subject at the end of JEE preparation. Even many students who start preparing in class 8 or earlier do not actually land in IITs.</p>
		<h4>Case 2: Students join coachings in class 9/10:</h4><p>In these classes students actually get a gist of portion of Science and Mathematics, in JEE. Also, there are many National level competitions(NTSE, Junior Science Olympiad) to actually judge your capabilities of competing at National level (Just like JEE). So, joining JEE coachings might not only help students to crack these exams but also, help them to actually have a flavour of JEE. Also, studying in class 9th and 10th help the students to clear their basics of science and maths.</p>
		<h4>Case 3: Students start in class 11th:</h4><p>As told above, actual JEE preparation starts in class 11 itself, since the portion of JEE comprises of both 11th and 12th. But, students might feel a lot of load coping up with portion of JEE, in the starting (because of its vast portion), so students who started in 9/10 might be at some edge considering the load bearing capability, they had earlier. So while talking about the right time to kick start preparations for jee it's worthwhile to add a clause about the transition from a normal school kid to a student trying to get into IITs.</p>
		<h4>Case 4: Students start in class 12th</h4><p>Even though it is never too late to start. there are people who start in class 12 and clear jee with decent ranks but not everyone may be able to handle that much pressure. Starting from class 11 gives you ample time to adjust from the class 10 cbse mode to JEE mode which is not an easy task.</p>
		<h6>So, according to our above Analysis, it is best to join some coaching early in class 9/10th or 11th, but not too early, i.e. in class 8th. Also, many surveys shows that most of the IITians generally start preparing for JEE in the 10th or 11th standard itself.</h6>
