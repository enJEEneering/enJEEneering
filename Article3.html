        <p>Many students who work real hard in preparing for the exam are unable to perform in the actual examination. Actually, the problem here is not your lack of hard work but your inefficiency in ability to attempt the paper. A very large army can be defeated by a small army with a very good strategy, in a similar way, you can score better with a good strategy and better Time Management. So, in order to prevent your hardwork from getting wasted one should employ certain strategies in the examination.</p>
		<h4>1. Equal time for all the subjects</h4><p> Equal time must be given for all the three subjects(say 40min each in the first round)..DO NOT over attempt in any section, leaving other sections un-attempted. This is an issue faced by students who do not check time regularly and are carried away by the flow of questions. These students Should focus on Time Management. (try reading or listening to audiobooks like ‘15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management’ or 'Organise Tomorrow Today ’)</p>

		<h4>2.Solve the whole paper in ‘iterations’</h4> <p>By ‘iterations’ we mean, you should go through the questions not once, but twice or thrice, solving each question on its merit. So, in the first iterations you should start from question 1 through the last, solving only those questions which hardly takes 30-40 seconds to solve. In the second ‘iteration’ solve medium level questions which takes 1-2 minutes to solve. And the third iteration should be used to solve questions which are easy but time consuming. After this if you are left with some time try attempting hard questions.</p>
        <h4>3.Rough work has to be organised. </h4> <p> One important strategy is to oraganise the rough work. The so called 'silly' mistakes creep in because of not organising your work properly. To reduce such mistakes it is important to be conscious and concentrated throughout the examination. To increase your concentration levels please try to actually put in effort during mock exams which will ultimately show result in the final exam.
Most importantly, every student should develop the ability to CHOOSE those questions which he/she can solve easily. Attempting all questions was never the key to succeed in JEE rather answering a decent amount of questions correctly matters.</p>
         <p>It is really important to be in a position to apply whatever you have learnt. Because at the end of the day all that matters is how well you have performed in those 3 hours in Mains (and 6 hours in case of Advanced). So writing each exam as the final exam would actually make a difference for your good.</p>
